## Design Direction

The design should evoke precision, trust, and professionalism - qualities essential for financial applications. Clean lines, generous whitespace, and a focus on data readability should dominate. The interface should feel like a professional financial terminal, not a consumer app.

## Color Selection

A sophisticated financial palette with deep blue tones and high-contrast elements for maximum data readability.

- **Primary Color**: `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)` - Deep professional blue that conveys trust and stability, perfect for financial applications
- **Secondary Colors**: `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)` - Very light blue-gray for subtle backgrounds and cards
- **Accent Color**: `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)` - Fresh teal for interactive elements and successful states, provides visual interest without overwhelming
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White `oklch(0.99 0 0)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 11.5:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Teal `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue-Gray `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 10.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should be technical and legible, optimized for displaying numerical data and currency codes with clarity.

**Primary**: IBM Plex Sans - A technical, professional typeface designed for clarity at all sizes, particularly excellent for displaying financial data and technical content
**Monospace**: JetBrains Mono - For currency codes and numerical values to ensure perfect alignment

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): IBM Plex Sans Bold/32px/tight letter spacing/-0.02em
  - H2 (Section Headers): IBM Plex Sans Semibold/20px/normal/0em
  - Body (Table Data): IBM Plex Sans Regular/15px/relaxed line-height/0em
  - Currency Codes: JetBrains Mono Medium/14px/normal/0.01em
  - Numeric Values: JetBrains Mono Regular/15px/tabular-nums enabled

## Animations

Animations should be minimal and purposeful, reinforcing the professional nature of the application while providing clear feedback.

Subtle fade-ins for data appearing (200ms), smooth loading spinner rotation, and gentle hover states on interactive elements. Avoid bouncy or playful animations - keep everything measured and precise like the financial data being displayed.
