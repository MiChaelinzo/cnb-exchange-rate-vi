## Design Direction

The design should evoke precision, trust, and professionalism - qualities essential for financial applications. Clean lines, generous whitespace, and a focus on data readability should dominate. The interface should feel like a professional financial terminal, not a consumer app.

## Color Selection

A sophisticated financial palette with deep blue tones and high-contrast elements for maximum data readability.

- **Primary Color**: `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)` - Deep professional blue that conveys trust and stability, perfect for financial applications
- **Secondary Colors**: `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)` - Very light blue-gray for subtle backgrounds and cards
- **Accent Color**: `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)` - Fresh teal for interactive elements and successful states, provides visual interest without overwhelming
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White `oklch(0.99 0 0)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 11.5:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Teal `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue-Gray `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 10.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should be technical and legible, optimized for displaying numerical data and currency codes with clarity.

**Primary**: IBM Plex Sans - A technical, professional typeface designed for clarity at all sizes, particularly excellent for displaying financial data and technical content
**Monospace**: JetBrains Mono - For currency codes and numerical values to ensure perfect alignment

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): IBM Plex Sans Bold/32px/tight letter spacing/-0.02em
  - H2 (Section Headers): IBM Plex Sans Semibold/20px/normal/0em
  - Body (Table Data): IBM Plex Sans Regular/15px/relaxed line-height/0em
  - Currency Codes: JetBrains Mono Medium/14px/normal/0.01em
  - Numeric Values: JetBrains Mono Regular/15px/tabular-nums enabled

## Animations

Animations should be minimal and purposeful, reinforcing the professional nature of the application while providing clear feedback.

Subtle fade-ins for data appearing (200ms), smooth loading spinner rotation, and gentle hover states on interactive elements. Avoid bouncy or playful animations - keep everything measured and precise like the financial data being displayed.

### Filter Preset Management System
- **Functionality**: Allows users to save, name, and reuse filter configurations across all sections of the application, with AI-powered smart recommendations based on usage patterns, time of day, and similar filter combinations
- **Purpose**: Enables power users to quickly switch between frequently-used filter combinations, improving efficiency and workflow; provides intelligent suggestions to discover new useful filtering strategies
- **Trigger**: User configures filters in any section (Exchange Rate Table, Advanced Search, Comparison, etc.) and clicks save preset button; recommendations appear automatically based on context and usage patterns
- **Progression**: User applies filters → Clicks "Save Preset" button → Dialog opens → Enters preset name, description (optional), and category → Saves → Preset stored persistently → Can load preset later from any compatible section → Filters automatically applied → Smart Recommendations card displays AI-powered suggestions → Shows usage-based recommendations (frequent patterns at specific times/days) → Shows time-based recommendations (morning reviews, end-of-day checks, weekly overviews) → Shows similar preset recommendations when user has active filters → User can apply recommendation instantly → User can save recommendation as new preset with pre-filled details → AI analyzes user's preset patterns and generates contextual suggestions → Recommendations update automatically based on time and behavior → Usage tracking records when presets are applied → Generates insights like "You often use this preset on Mondays around 9:00"
- **Success criteria**: 
  - Presets save successfully with all filter parameters
  - Presets persist across browser sessions using `useKV` hook
  - Presets can be loaded and applied instantly

  - Time-based recommendations suggest relevant presets (morning review, afternoon check, weekly overview, Friday summary)
  - Similar preset recommendations show filters close to current selection
  - AI recommendations provide 3-5 contextual suggestions with reasons
  - Recommendations include preset name, description, category, and filters
  - Each recommendation shows type badge (AI Powered, Based on Usage, Time-Based, Similar Filters)
  - Top recommendations marked with "Top Pick" badge (score ≥ 8)
  - Apply button instantly loads recommended filters

### Historical Rate Calendar View with Heatmap
- **Functionality**: Interactive calendar visualization displaying historical exchange rates for a selected currency over multiple months, with color-coded heatmap cells representing rate strength, detailed tooltips showing exact rates on hover, and the ability to navigate through different time periods
- **Purpose**: Enables users to quickly identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in historical exchange rates through intuitive visual representation; helps spot seasonal variations, significant rate changes, and optimal exchange periods at a glance
- **Trigger**: User navigates to "History" tab (distinct from "Prediction History"), selects a currency from dropdown, and views calendar heatmap
- **Progression**: User navigates to History tab → Sees calendar heatmap interface → Selects currency from dropdown (defaults to EUR) → Calendar displays current month with color-coded cells for each day → Each cell shows: weekday, day number, and rate value → Hover reveals detailed tooltip (full date, currency name/code, exact rate, comparison to period average) → Previous/Next month navigation buttons allow browsing historical data → Color intensity represents rate strength (stronger rate = warmer color, weaker = cooler color) → "Today" indicator highlights current date → Weekend days display with muted styling → Future dates shown as disabled/empty → Missing data (weekends, holidays) shown with distinct empty state → Month/Year selector in header → Can switch currencies to compare different historical patterns → Loading states show skeleton calendar while fetching data → Smooth transitions when changing months or currencies
- **Success criteria**: Calendar renders current month by default with accurate day/date alignment; fetches historical rates from CNB API for selected month and currency; color-coded heatmap uses 5-7 color gradients based on rate percentiles within displayed period; tooltips display on hover with full date, currency info, exact rate, and percentage comparison to period average; navigation buttons fetch and display adjacent months seamlessly; loading skeletons maintain calendar structure during data fetch; weekend styling (muted/disabled appearance); current day highlighted with distinct border/badge; future dates shown as empty/disabled; missing data gracefully handled with "No Data" cell state; currency selector dropdown populated with all available currencies; month/year displayed prominently in header; smooth animations between month transitions; mobile-responsive calendar (stacks to smaller grid on mobile, maintains touch-friendly cells); color legend explains heatmap scale (weakest to strongest); accessible color choices (colorblind-friendly palette); supports navigation back 12+ months; each cell minimum 60px for readability; proper date calculations (leap years, month lengths); batch API fetching for entire month to minimize requests; caches fetched month data to avoid re-fetching; proper handling of API failures with retry option; compare selected day to period average in tooltip; rate formatting consistent with rest of app (3 decimal places); empty state when no currency selected; info alert explaining calendar functionality; keyboard navigation support (arrow keys to navigate days, Enter to view details); integrates seamlessly with existing History tab structure
