# Planning Guide

A professional Czech National Bank (CNB) Exchange Rate Viewer application that displays real-time currency exchange rates fetched directly from the official CNB API.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, business-focused design that conveys trust and reliability for financial data
2. **Efficient** - Fast loading with clear feedback states and minimal distractions from the core data
3. **Interactive** - Practical currency conversion tools that make exchange rate data immediately useful

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- This is a focused data display and conversion application with real CNB API integration, error handling, loading states, data filtering/sorting, and real-time currency conversion. The application fetches live exchange rates using a CORS proxy solution.

## Essential Features

### Exchange Rate Data Fetching
- **Functionality**: Retrieves current exchange rates from CNB public API with intelligent multi-proxy fallback system
- **Purpose**: Provides real, live data from official Czech banking sources with maximum reliability
- **Trigger**: Automatic on page load, with manual refresh option
- **Progression**: User loads page → Loading indicator appears → API call via primary proxy → If fails, automatically tries backup proxy → Data parsed and displayed → Success state shown
- **Success criteria**: Live exchange rates display accurately with currency codes, amounts, and rates clearly visible; system gracefully handles proxy failures

### Data Table Display
- **Functionality**: Shows exchange rates in a sortable, scannable table format
- **Purpose**: Enables users to quickly find and compare currency rates
- **Trigger**: After successful data fetch
- **Progression**: Data received → Parsed into table rows → Rendered with proper formatting → Sorting/filtering available
- **Success criteria**: All currencies visible with proper decimal formatting, currency codes, and country names

### Error Handling & Loading States
- **Functionality**: Displays clear feedback during loading and when errors occur
- **Purpose**: Keeps users informed about application state and provides recovery options
- **Trigger**: During API calls and on API failures
- **Progression**: Request starts → Loading shown → On error: error message displayed with retry option → User can retry
- **Success criteria**: Never shows blank screen; always provides feedback and recovery path

### Date & Time Display
- **Functionality**: Shows the date for which exchange rates are valid
- **Purpose**: Ensures users know the currency data timestamp
- **Trigger**: Displayed with fetched data
- **Progression**: Data received → Date extracted → Formatted and prominently displayed
- **Success criteria**: Date clearly visible and formatted in readable format

### Currency Converter Calculator
- **Functionality**: Converts amounts between any two currencies using live exchange rates
- **Purpose**: Provides immediate practical value by allowing users to calculate currency conversions
- **Trigger**: User enters amount and selects currencies
- **Progression**: User inputs amount → Selects from/to currencies → Real-time calculation displayed → Result shown with clear formatting
- **Success criteria**: Accurate conversions using CNB rates, instant updates on input changes, all currencies available including CZK

### Currency Trend Chart Visualization
- **Functionality**: Displays historical exchange rate trends over customizable time periods with multiple interactive chart types (line, bar, area, daily change) and comprehensive trend analysis
- **Purpose**: Enables users to analyze currency movements, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on historical data with rich statistical insights
- **Trigger**: User selects currency, time range (7-90 days), and chart type
- **Progression**: User selects currency → Chooses time range → Selects chart type → Batch fetching begins with parallel requests → Progress tracked → Chart rendered with trend analysis → Detailed statistics displayed (overall trend, max increase/decrease, volatility, average change) → User explores interactive tooltips showing day-to-day changes → Can switch chart types or refresh data
- **Success criteria**: Smooth, responsive charts with accurate historical rates in all four formats; parallel batch processing completes efficiently; clear trend indicators with percentage changes; informative tooltips with formatted dates and change calculations; comprehensive trend statistics; graceful handling of partial data; automatic proxy fallback for reliability

## Edge Case Handling

- **API Timeout/Network Failure**: Display friendly error message with retry button, automatic proxy fallback, and troubleshooting hints
- **CORS Proxy Failure**: Automatically switch to backup proxy service without user intervention
- **Malformed API Response**: Graceful fallback with error logging and user notification
- **Empty Data Set**: Show empty state with explanation and refresh action
- **Slow Connection**: Progressive loading indicator with timeout handling (10s per request)
- **Stale Data**: Display last update timestamp to inform users of data freshness
- **Invalid Conversion Input**: Handle non-numeric or negative amounts gracefully without errors
- **Same Currency Conversion**: Allow but show 1:1 conversion correctly
- **Historical Data Unavailable**: Show appropriate empty state when chart data cannot be fetched with suggestions
- **Partial Historical Data**: Display available data with warning when some dates fail to fetch
- **Weekend/Holiday Gaps**: Chart automatically excludes non-trading days to show accurate trend lines
- **Long-term Data Loading**: Progressive batch loading with clear progress indication for chart data
- **Chart Type Switching**: Instant transitions between line, bar, area, and change chart types without refetching
- **Multiple Proxy Failures**: Exhaust all proxy options with retries before showing error to user

## Design Direction

The design should evoke precision, trust, and professionalism - qualities essential for financial applications. Clean lines, generous whitespace, and a focus on data readability should dominate. The interface should feel like a professional financial terminal, not a consumer app.

## Color Selection

A sophisticated financial palette with deep blue tones and high-contrast elements for maximum data readability.

- **Primary Color**: `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)` - Deep professional blue that conveys trust and stability, perfect for financial applications
- **Secondary Colors**: `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)` - Very light blue-gray for subtle backgrounds and cards
- **Accent Color**: `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)` - Fresh teal for interactive elements and successful states, provides visual interest without overwhelming
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White `oklch(0.99 0 0)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 11.5:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue `oklch(0.35 0.12 250)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Teal `oklch(0.55 0.18 160)`): White text `oklch(0.99 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue-Gray `oklch(0.92 0.02 250)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 250)` - Ratio 10.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should be technical and legible, optimized for displaying numerical data and currency codes with clarity.

**Primary**: IBM Plex Sans - A technical, professional typeface designed for clarity at all sizes, particularly excellent for displaying financial data and technical content
**Monospace**: JetBrains Mono - For currency codes and numerical values to ensure perfect alignment

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): IBM Plex Sans Bold/32px/tight letter spacing/-0.02em
  - H2 (Section Headers): IBM Plex Sans Semibold/20px/normal/0em
  - Body (Table Data): IBM Plex Sans Regular/15px/relaxed line-height/0em
  - Currency Codes: JetBrains Mono Medium/14px/normal/0.01em
  - Numeric Values: JetBrains Mono Regular/15px/tabular-nums enabled

## Animations

Animations should be minimal and purposeful, reinforcing the professional nature of the application while providing clear feedback.

Subtle fade-ins for data appearing (200ms), smooth loading spinner rotation, and gentle hover states on interactive elements. Avoid bouncy or playful animations - keep everything measured and precise like the financial data being displayed.
